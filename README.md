# REVENUE-OPTIMIZATION-FOR-BATTERY-STORAGE

Modelling energy production is a core task for those developing, financing, and operating renewable energy projects. However, with battery storage, since no energy is being produced, the main consideration to model is when should the battery charge and discharge? To answer this we need to define what we mean by “should” and come up with a way to represent the physical attributes of battery storage and the commercial/market rules for how they are allowed to operate. This type of problem lends itself to a method called optimization. We define an objective (the “should”), apply constraints (which captures the physical and commercial/market attributes), and determine the decisions that lead to the best outcome. This case study describes the intuition behind optimization and how applying different constraints impacts results.
